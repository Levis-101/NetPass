# NetPass
NetPass: A Wi-Fi monetization system. It uses a captive portal to redirect users to payment gateways (Stripe/M-Pesa). Once paid, it whitelists the device MAC address via iptables for a set duration. Built with Python/Flask, it bridges network automation with secure subscription billing—perfect for cafes and small business hotspots.
